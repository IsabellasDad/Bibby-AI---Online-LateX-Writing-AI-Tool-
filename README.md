## Why Other Tools Will Give You a Headache

### 1. Overleaf

This is the old, traditional way. Many people use it, but they also face many problems.

- **Famous for Crashing:** Ask any student. Overleaf is famous for crashing right before a deadline. It's a very stressful experience.
- **No Smart Help:** It's just a plain editor. It will not help you write better or check your grammar properly. You have to do everything yourself.
- **Difficult for New Users:** If you are new to LaTeX, Overleaf can be very confusing and difficult to learn.

### 2. Jenni AI and Similar Tools

These are new AI tools, but they are not made for serious academic work. They are more like toys.

- **Full of Bugs:** These tools are often unreliable. You might lose your work, or the features might stop working suddenly.
- **AI is Not Very Smart:** Their AI is for general writing. It doesn't understand academic topics deeply and can make silly mistakes in your paper.
- **Creates More Work:** You have to write in their tool and then copy-paste into another. This is a big waste of time and creates formatting problems.
